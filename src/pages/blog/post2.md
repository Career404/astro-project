## So far... that is awesome
\
There's no need to make content-centered sites reactive, client-rendered - I've actually worked on a static landing once, that was only static for search engine optimization. Generally, I like static sites, but making them by hand is quite a tedious thing to do. Tiring also.
\
\
And that's why astro is so cool. This feels so much faster, easier and more... fun!
\
\
Astro will allow me to finish that Cyberpunk 2020 assistant quicker, refactor the posts as components, so and so, and I will probably learn a lot in the process.

Another thing - I really can't wait to learn about the islands architecture (and how to use it)
